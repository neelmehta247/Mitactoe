# Mitactoe
Mitactoe is a game of tic-tac-toe which uses only Xs and the goal of the game is to lose. Basically, you have to force your opponent into making the move which makes it 4 in a row. This game is better than tic-tac-toe since you can never have a draw and is also more challenging since only Xs can be used and no Os.
